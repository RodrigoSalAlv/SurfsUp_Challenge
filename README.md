# SurfsUp Analysis

## Project Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to see the main differences between two different months, separated by two totally different seasons and how much are affected the temperatures between the two of them.

## Results
### Analysis Results

For the month of June we can see the next callouts:
- The mean temperature for hole month, in the years retrieved, is 74.9°F
- The Standard Deviation is over the 3 points, this tell us the temperature could vary 3°F along the months (That's not so much in terms of temperature)
- The 75% of the data obtained are over 73°F, this can be interpreted as the temperature of 75% of the days in June are over 73°F

For the month of December we can see the next callouts:
- The mean temperature for hole month in the years retrieved, is 71°F
- The Standard Deviation is almost 4 points, this tell us the temperature could vary 3°F along the months (That's also not so much in terms of temperature)
- The 50% of the data obtained are over 71°F, this can be interpreted as the temperature of 50% of the days in June are over 71°F

## Summary
Speaking specifically of the months of June and December we can see there is no so much difference between the mean of temperatures of both of them. Both monhts along the years ate between the temperatures of 70-75°F, we could say that, in terms of temperature, there are not a great difference in both months.

Also, speaking of minimum of temperatures, we can see that in both months, less of 1% of the samples (from the hole sample of days) has reach the minimum temperature:

For the month of June there are 1700 different samples of temperatures vs the month December where are only 1517 samples, this due to because, for December the data of 2017 is not available.
